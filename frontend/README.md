# Frontend Repo for Cross-Chain Token Swap using HTLC Smart Contract

This repository contains the frontend code for a cross-chain token swap application that utilizes the Hash Time-Locked Contract (HTLC) smart contract. The application supports token swaps between the Mumbai Matic and Sepolia networks.

## Stack

The project is built using the following technologies:

- [RainbowKit](https://rainbowkit.com): RainbowKit is a toolkit for integrating wallets into decentralized applications. It provides a customizable wallet connection flow.

- [wagmi](https://wagmi.sh): wagmi is a library that allows interaction with the Ethereum blockchain. It provides functions and utilities for sending transactions, interacting with smart contracts, and more.

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/): Next.js is a React framework for building server-side rendered and static websites. It provides an intuitive development experience and powerful features for building modern web applications.

The project was bootstrapped with [`create-rainbowkit`](https://github.com/rainbow-me/rainbowkit/tree/main/packages/create-rainbowkit), which sets up the initial project structure and configuration.
